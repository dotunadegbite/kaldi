The optional-silence phone sil occupies 38.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 64.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 14.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 9.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (33,37.2,76)
